# veske-game-engine

---

A work-in-progress game engine.

This game engine is a personal study of mine and I hope to build a fully functional game out of it some day, something 2-dimensional and desktop based, pixel art in style. I am using a library called [Simple DirectMedia Layer](https://www.libsdl.org/).

Things to do (not in order):

1. Finish collision detection and response

2. Level loading and serialization

3. Characters and controllers

4. Make game
