# veske-game-engine

A work-in-progress game engine I am hoping to build from the ground up.

This game engine is a personal goal/study of mine and I hope to build a fully functional game out of it some day, something 2-dimensional and desktop based, most likely pixel art in style. I am more intersted in the work behind programming game objects move and interact with each other in the game world than I am with directly programming the operating system, so instead of writing with solely the Windows API, I am using a fantastic library called [Simple DirectMedia Layer](https://www.libsdl.org/).

While I doubt anyone will ever see this page, if you do happen accross my code, internet wanderer, feel free to use it in any way you wish.
